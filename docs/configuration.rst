Configuration
=============

The configuration file is a normal Python script. The status bar is controlled by a central
:py:class:`.Status` object, which individual *modules* like a :py:mod:`.clock` or a :py:mod:`.battery`
monitor are added to with the ``register`` method.

A typical configuration file could look like this (note the additional
dependencies from :py:mod:`.network` and :py:mod:`.pulseaudio` in this
example):

.. code:: python

    from i3pystatus import Status

    status = Status(standalone=True)

    # Displays clock like this:
    # Tue 30 Jul 11:59:46 PM KW31
    #                          ^-- calendar week
    status.register("clock",
        format="%a %-d %b %X KW%V",)

    # Shows the average load of the last minute and the last 5 minutes
    # (the default value for format is used)
    status.register("load")

    # Shows your CPU temperature, if you have a Intel CPU
    status.register("temp",
        format="{temp:.0f}°C",)

    # The battery monitor has many formatting options, see README for details

    # This would look like this, when discharging (or charging)
    # ↓14.22W 56.15% [77.81%] 2h:41m
    # And like this if full:
    # =14.22W 100.0% [91.21%]
    #
    # This would also display a desktop notification (via D-Bus) if the percentage
    # goes below 5 percent while discharging. The block will also color RED.
    # If you don't have a desktop notification demon yet, take a look at dunst:
    #   http://www.knopwob.org/dunst/
    status.register("battery",
        format="{status}/{consumption:.2f}W {percentage:.2f}% [{percentage_design:.2f}%] {remaining:%E%hh:%Mm}",
        alert=True,
        alert_percentage=5,
        status={
            "DIS": "↓",
            "CHR": "↑",
            "FULL": "=",
        },)

    # This would look like this:
    # Discharging 6h:51m
    status.register("battery",
        format="{status} {remaining:%E%hh:%Mm}",
        alert=True,
        alert_percentage=5,
        status={
            "DIS":  "Discharging",
            "CHR":  "Charging",
            "FULL": "Bat full",
        },)

    # Displays whether a DHCP client is running
    status.register("runwatch",
        name="DHCP",
        path="/var/run/dhclient*.pid",)

    # Shows the address and up/down state of eth0. If it is up the address is shown in
    # green (the default value of color_up) and the CIDR-address is shown
    # (i.e. 10.10.10.42/24).
    # If it's down just the interface name (eth0) will be displayed in red
    # (defaults of format_down and color_down)
    #
    # Note: the network module requires PyPI package netifaces
    status.register("network",
        interface="eth0",
        format_up="{v4cidr}",)

    # Note: requires both netifaces and basiciw (for essid and quality)
    status.register("network",
        interface="wlan0",
        format_up="{essid} {quality:03.0f}%",)

    # Shows disk usage of /
    # Format:
    # 42/128G [86G]
    status.register("disk",
        path="/",
        format="{used}/{total}G [{avail}G]",)

    # Shows pulseaudio default sink volume
    #
    # Note: requires libpulseaudio from PyPI
    status.register("pulseaudio",
        format="♪{volume}",)

    # Shows mpd status
    # Format:
    # Cloud connected▶Reroute to Remain
    status.register("mpd",
        format="{title}{status}{album}",
        status={
            "pause": "▷",
            "play": "▶",
            "stop": "◾",
        },)

    status.run()

Also change your i3wm config to the following:

.. code:: ini

    # i3bar
    bar {
        status_command    python ~/.path/to/your/config/file.py
        position          top
        workspace_buttons yes
    }

.. note::
    Don't name your config file ``i3pystatus.py``

Settings that require credentials can utilize the keyring module to keep sensitive information out of config files.
To take advantage of this feature, simply use the setting_util.py script to set the credentials for a module. Once this
is done you can add the module to your config without specifying the credentials, eg:

.. code:: python

    # Use the default keyring to retrieve credentials.
    # To determine which backend is the default on your system, run
    # python -c 'import keyring; print(keyring.get_keyring())'
    status.register('github')

If you don't want to use the default you can set a specific keyring like so:

.. code:: python

    from keyring.backends.file import PlaintextKeyring
    status.register('github', keyring_backend=PlaintextKeyring())

i3pystatus will locate and set the credentials during the module loading process. Currently supported credentals are "password", "email" and "username".
